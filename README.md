# Task-01: Population Data Visualization
# Objective

The goal of this task is to create visualizations (bar chart & histogram) to understand the distribution of categorical or continuous variables.

Using the World Bank Population Dataset, we analyze the distribution of populations across countries.

# Dataset

Source: World Bank Dataset

** File: API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_38144.csv

Description: Contains total population by country and year (1960–2024).

# Steps Performed

Imported dataset using Pandas.

Cleaned data by removing regional aggregates (e.g., "World", "Europe & Central Asia").

Selected a specific year (e.g., 2020) for visualization.

Created two plots:

Bar Chart → Top 10 most populated countries.

Histogram → Distribution of populations across all countries.

# Visualizations
1 Bar Chart – Top 10 Populated Countries (2020)

Shows the largest countries by population.

2️ Histogram – Distribution of Country Populations (2020)

Shows how populations are spread across different countries.

# How to Run
# Install dependencies:

pip install pandas matplotlib

# Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook TASK(1).ipynb

# Requirements

Python 3.x

Pandas

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

# Outcome

This task helps visualize population distribution using bar charts and histograms. Such techniques can be applied to any categorical or continuous data like ages, incomes, or survey results.
